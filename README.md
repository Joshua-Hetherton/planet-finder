# planet-finder

## Desktop Version
The Desktop version of this app displays real-time astronomical data for planets and other celestial objects
It is built using 'customtkinter' for the user-interface, and uses the [Skyfield](https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/) API to compute the positions of objects and visibility from earth

### Key Features
- Viewing the Current Altitude, Azimuth and Distance of a selected object
- Identifies which planets are currently visible above the users horizon
- Getting Rising and setting times for any selected celestial body
- Viewing a planets apparent magnitude (brightness)
- Data is calculated based on your longitude and latitude
- Uses JSON files to store and retrieve the users settings

### Planned Features
- Orbital data such as apoapsis and periapsis estimations, which isn't native to the Skyfield API
- Allowing greater functionality to viewing selected objects, as planets are only being tracked right now
- Showing key locations around the planets
- In the far future, and if I am confident enough, making a map of the milky way!
## Pi Version
To be Implemented
